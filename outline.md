## About Me
 - profile
I co-founded and have been running a startup for over 10 years. From its nascent stages to its current scale of 60+ employees, I’ve been instrumental in its growth. In the early days, I architected and developed the core infrastructure using tools like AWS, PHP, and Golang.

Now, I wear multiple hats—from leading a product and engineering team, overseeing hiring, management, and development, to managing an entire business division and being responsible for the P/L. Currently, I am also leading AI application development, writing code alongside other engineers.

In addition to my role as CTO, I also serve as an advisor and consultant for multiple companies, helping CEOs run effective engineering teams and create clear-cut IT strategies.
